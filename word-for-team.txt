Hey guys,

if you're reading this, then you probably still check the repositry. i wrote this on the last day right after submitting my LSR. Both of you were true team. I am really glad that I didn't lose hope in working as a teammember after swinburne's group selection method was disastrous. Besides being thankful to have worked with sucha team, I was delighted to know such great people with great personalities. You guys tolerated my attitude all the time, and had not showed me any negative reaction towards some of my actions, but thanks for both of you of accepting me and tolerating my stress. You guys always offered me help whenever i asked for it, and you put in limited effort for that. I wish I can see you guys again in the future, and I hope that we can stay in touch forever. 

If Professor Patrick manages to read this, he should know that in very minor incidents and situations he was able to change alot in me. I never thought I'd feel this way when somebody criticized me, but he was there to give me all the fuel to run towards my dream. This guy has showed me the belief i needed as a person, unlike 99% of the lecturers, yet there are a very few who are nice and genuine. I'm sorry if I ever showed attitude, I will forever be greatful to all what I learned from you. I hope one day I can make you guys proud of me.

Regards,
